# Strategy > Tactics

## The Hook
**Stop asking "How?" Start asking "Why?"**

Managers execute. Directors strategize.

Strategy is the art of saying "No" to good ideas so you can focus on the *great* idea.

## The Framework: Build vs. Buy
The most strategic technical decision is often **not to build anything.**

*   *Engineers:* "Let's build our own authentication system! It will be fun."
*   *Director:* "No. We are not an auth company. We will buy Auth0. Focus your brainpower on our core differentiator."

## The Script
**Scenario:** The team wants to adopt a flashy new framework.

**Say this:**
> "This technology is cool, but does it solve a business problem that our current stack cannot? Does it help us ship faster, or does it just add complexity? Unless the ROI is 10x, the cost of migration isn't worth it. Let's stick to boring technology."
