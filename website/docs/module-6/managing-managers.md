# Managing Managers (MOM)

## The Hook
**The feedback loop is now 6 months.**

When you manage ICs, you see code daily. When you manage managers, you might not see the result of your coaching for two quarters.

You are now "debugging the process," not the code.

## The Framework: Skip-Level Meetings
You cannot trust your managers' reports blindly. You need ground truth.

*   **The Tactic:** Once a month, meet with the engineers who report to your managers.
*   **The Rule:** This is not to spy. It is to ask: "Is your manager supporting you? Do you have what you need?"

## The Challenge
**The Delegation Audit.**

Identify one responsibility you are holding onto because "it's just easier if I do it." (e.g., Running the weekly staff meeting).

Hand it to your strongest emerging leader. Tell them: "I want you to own this. I'll support you, but you drive."

Then step back.
