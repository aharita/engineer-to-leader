# 3.4 Estimating the Unknown

## The Hook

**Estimates are lies. Everyone knows it, but they ask anyway.**

The problem isn't that estimates are wrong; the problem is that managers treat "Guesses" as "Promises."

When you commit to a date, you are putting your team's nights and weekends on the line.

## The Framework: Probability Forecasting

Never give a single date. Give a **Range** and a **Confidence Interval**.

- **Bad:** "It will be done by Friday."
- **Good:** "We have 80% confidence it will be done by Friday. There is a 20% risk that the API integration issues push it to Tuesday."

---

## The Script

**Scenario:** Leadership asks "When will Project X be done?"

**Say this:**

> "Based on what we know today, we are targeting end of month. However, we still have two unknowns regarding the payment gateway. Once we prototype that next week, I can give you a firm commit date. Right now, treat that date as 'Optimistic'."

## The Challenge

### The "Cone of Uncertainty" Check

Review your current project plan. Are there tasks marked "In Progress" that have been there for weeks?

That isn't a "2-day task" anymore. It is a blocked task.

Go find the engineer and ask: "What is the one thing preventing this from moving?"

Update the estimate immediately. Bad news is better early than late.
