# 3.3 Technical Debt as a Financial Instrument

## The Hook

**Stop complaining about "messy code." Speak the language of risk.**

Business stakeholders do not care about "clean code" or "refactoring." They care about **Speed** and **Stability**.

If you ask for time to "cleanup," they will say no. You must reframe Technical Debt as "Financial Debt."

## The Framework: The Interest Rate

Explain debt using the "Credit Card" analogy:

- We swiped the credit card to ship the feature fast for the demo. That was the right business move.
- Now we are paying interest. Every new feature takes 20% longer to build because of that debt.
- **The Ask:** We need to pay down the principal to lower our "interest rate" (development time) back to normal.

## The Script

**Scenario:** Negotiating the roadmap with a Product Manager who wants 100% features.

**Say this:**

> "We can build those features, but our current velocity has slowed down because of the legacy billing code. If we don't address it, the Q4 features will likely be late and unstable. I propose we allocate 20% of this sprint to refactoring the billing module. This will make the Q4 build 30% faster. Do you want speed now or speed later?"

## The Challenge

### The 20% Tax

Make it a hard rule: **20% of every sprint is reserved for engineering tasks** (refactoring, tooling, library upgrades).

Do not ask for permission. Just include it in your capacity planning. This is the cost of doing business, just like paying the electricity bill.

## Key Takeaways

:::tip Remember
Reframe technical debt as financial debt with interest rates. Business stakeholders understand "paying 20% interest on every feature" better than "messy code."
