# Module 3: Operational Excellence (Process)

**Theme:** Building the machine that builds the product.

---

This module focuses on the mechanics of engineering management: process, stability, and debt. You'll learn how to run effective meetings, manage incidents, handle technical debt, and provide realistic estimates.

## What You'll Learn

### 3.1 The "Meetings as API" Philosophy
Learn how to treat meetings like API calls with clear inputs, outputs, and error handling to protect your team's maker time.

### 3.2 Incident Command for Managers
Master the art of staying calm during outages and leading your team through incidents as an Incident Commander, not a debugger.

### 3.3 Technical Debt as a Financial Instrument
Stop complaining about "messy code" and learn to speak the language of risk by reframing technical debt as financial debt.

### 3.4 Estimating the Unknown
Move beyond single-date promises and learn to provide probability forecasts with confidence intervals that protect your team.
