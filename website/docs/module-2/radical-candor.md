# 2.2 Radical Candor for Introverts

## The Hook

**Being "nice" is selfish.**

If a senior engineer writes messy code or speaks over juniors in meetings, and you say nothing because you don't want to be "mean," you are failing.

This is called **Ruinous Empathy**. You are prioritizing your own comfort over their growth. When they eventually get passed over for promotion, it will be your fault.

## The Framework: SBI (Situation - Behavior - Impact)

Engineers appreciate data. Feedback often fails because it is vague ("You need to be more collaborative").

Use the SBI model to make feedback irrefutable and actionable:

- **Situation:** When and where did it happen?
- **Behavior:** What exactly did they do? (Observable facts only).
- **Impact:** What was the result?

## The Script

**Scenario:** A Senior Engineer interrupted a Junior during a design review.

**Don't say:** "You were rude in the meeting."

**Say this (SBI):**

> "In the design review this morning (Situation), when Alex was explaining the schema, you cut him off and said 'that won't work' before he finished (Behavior). The result was that Alex shut down and stopped contributing for the rest of the meeting (Impact). We need to create space for juniors to learn. Next time, please wait until they finish."

## The Challenge

### The 2-Minute Feedback

Find one person on your team who did something well or poorly in the last 24 hours. Pull them aside (or DM them) and give them one specific piece of SBI feedback.

**Do it now.** Feedback has a half-life; waiting makes it less effective.
