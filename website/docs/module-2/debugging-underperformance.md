# 2.3 Debugging Underperformance (The PIP)

## The Hook

**You are waiting too long to fire them.**

New managers hope underperformance will magically fix itself. It won't.

Every day you tolerate a low performer, you are punishing your high performers. They have to pick up the slack/fix the bugs. If you don't address the low performer, your high performers will quit.

## The Framework: Will vs. Skill

Before you start a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), diagnose the root cause:

1. **Low Skill / High Will:** They are trying hard but lack knowledge.  
   **Solution:** Training, pairing, mentorship.

2. **High Skill / Low Will:** They are capable but lazy or bored.  
   **Solution:** Honest conversation about motivation or a warning.

3. **Low Skill / Low Will:** They can't do it and don't care.  
   **Solution:** Exit the organization.

## The Script

**Scenario:** You need to have "The Talk" regarding a trend of missed deadlines.

**Say this:**

> "I want to talk about the gap between what is expected for a Senior Engineer and what I'm seeing. The expectation is that features are delivered fully tested. In the last three sprints, 40% of your tickets were returned by QA. This is impacting the team's velocity. What is causing this gap?"

## The Challenge

### The "Paper Trail" Start

If you have a report you are worried about, start a private document today. Date it. Write down exactly what happened (facts, not feelings).

**Entry Example:**
- *"Oct 12: Missed standup."*
- *"Oct 14: Pushed code that broke the build, did not respond for 3 hours."*

You cannot put someone on a PIP without data.
