# 2.4 Hiring: "Culture Add" vs. "Culture Fit"

## The Hook

**Stop hiring people who look/think like you.**

"Culture Fit" is often a lazy excuse for bias. It leads to a team where everyone has the same blind spots.

If your team is entirely backend engineers who love quiet coding, hiring another quiet backend engineer feels comfortable (Fit), but what you actually need is a loud, chaotic frontend engineer who questions requirements (Add).

## The Framework: The Bar Raiser

When interviewing, ask yourself:

> **"Is this person better than at least 50% of the current team in one specific area?"**

If they are just "average," don't hire. Over time, hiring average people lowers the team density.

## The Script

**Scenario:** Debriefing an interview with your hiring panel.

**The Panel says:** "I don't know, they just didn't seem like they'd vibe with us."

**You say:**

> "Let's be specific. 'Vibe' isn't a competency. Did they fail the communication signal? Did they lack technical depth? We need someone who challenges our assumptions, not someone who just agrees with us. Let's look at the notes for the architectural round."

## The Challenge

### Review the Job Description

Go look at an open role for your team.

Does it say "Must have 5 years of Java"?

**Change it to:**
> "Must have a track record of shipping complex distributed systems (Java/Go/Rust preferred)."

Hire for **capability**, not **history**.
