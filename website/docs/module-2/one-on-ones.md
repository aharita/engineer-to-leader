# 2.1 One-on-Ones: The Anti-Status Update

## The Hook

**Status updates are for Jira, not meetings.**

If you spend your 30-minute 1:1 asking "Is the API done?", you are wasting company money. You can read the status on the board.

1:1s are the only time you get to perform "maintenance" on your most expensive asset: the engineer. If you skip them, you won't know they are quitting until they hand you the resignation letter.

## The Framework: The 90/10 Rule

This is the engineer's meeting, not yours.

- **90% Listening:** They set the agenda. They talk. You listen for signals (burnout, boredom, conflict).
- **10% Coaching:** You ask questions to help them solve their own problems.
- **Frequency:** Weekly or bi-weekly. Non-negotiable. Never cancel; only reschedule.

## The Script

**Scenario:** Your report sits down and immediately starts listing tasks they finished.

**Interrupt and say:**

> "Hold on. I can see the board, so I know you're crushing the tickets. I want to use this time to talk about how you're feeling about the project. Are you enjoying the work, or is the current scope frustrating you?"

### The 3 Magic Questions

1. **"What is the most annoying part of your job right now?"**
2. **"Do you feel you are learning anything new on this project?"**
3. **"Is there anything I can do to unblock you?"**

## The Challenge

### The Calendar Audit

Look at your scheduled 1:1s for this week. If any of them are just "catch-ups" with no structure, add a recurring description to the calendar invite:

**Agenda:**
1. Sentiment/Morale
2. Career Growth
3. Blockers

## Key Takeaways

:::tip Remember
1:1s are maintenance for your team. Skip them, and you'll only find out about problems when it's too late.
