# Module 1: Meta-Management (Managing Managers)

**You are now one step removed from reality. It is terrifying.**

When you managed engineers, you could look at the PRs. You could see the work.
When you manage managers, you are managing a "Black Box." You input "Headcount and Strategy" and you hope "Software" comes out the other side.

You cannot micro-manage a manager. If you try, they will quit. You have to manage through *principles* and *signals*.

## 1. The "Coach, Don't Play" Rule
*Resisting the urge to be the 'Super-EM'.*

Your managers will make mistakes. They will run bad meetings. They will hire the wrong intern.
Your instinct is to jump in and fix it. **Don't.**
If you fix their problems, you rob them of the lesson. You are a safety net, not a crutch.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Incident:**
    *   *Manager:* Panics during an outage.
    *   *Director:* "I am watching. I will not intervene unless the company is about to die. Afterward, we will deconstruct your response."
*   **The Bad Hire:**
    *   *Manager:* Wants to hire a candidate with "red flags" because they are desperate.
    *   *Director:* "I see these risks (X, Y). If you hire them, you own the outcome. Are you willing to bet your reputation on this?" (Forces them to think).
*   **The Process Deviant:**
    *   *Manager:* Refuses to do Sprint Retrospectives.
    *   *Director:* "I don't care about the ritual. I care about the loop. Show me how your team improves over time. If you can't show improvement, you must adopt the standard ritual."

## 2. Skip-Level 1:1s (The Truth Serum)
*How to spy on your managers without being creepy.*

Your managers will filter information. They will tell you "Everything is fine" while the house burns.
You need a direct line to the ground floor. Enter the Skip-Level.
**Goal:** Not to undermine the manager, but to "Health Check" the environment.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Vibe Check:**
    *   *Manager:* "The team is happy."
    *   *Director (in Skip-Level):* "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to quit tomorrow?" (Engineer says "8"). Director realizes Manager is blind.
*   **The Broken Telephone:**
    *   *Manager:* "Management says we have to work weekends."
    *   *Director (in Skip-Level):* "I never said that. Your manager is using me as a scapegoat to push you. I will correct this."
*   **The Career Blocker:**
    *   *Manager:* "Dave isn't ready for promotion."
    *   *Director (in Skip-Level):* Realizes Dave is doing Staff-level work but the Manager is threatened by him. Director intervenes to prevent Dave from quitting.

## 3. The "Standardization" Balance
*Autonomy vs. Chaos.*

You have 4 teams. Team A uses Scrum. Team B uses Kanban. Team C uses "Vibes."
Do you force them to align?
**Rule:** Standardize the *Interface*, not the *Implementation*.
"I don't care how you work, but every Friday at 4 PM, your status report must look exactly like this."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Tool War:**
    *   *Manager A:* Wants Jira. *Manager B:* Wants Linear.
    *   *Director:* "We are using ONE tool. Standardization beats preference because we need to move engineers between teams. We use Linear. End of discussion."
*   **The Performance Review:**
    *   *Manager A:* Grades everyone "Exceeds." *Manager B:* Grades everyone "Meets."
    *   *Director:* "We are doing a calibration session. I will normalize your curves. You cannot be the 'Cool Dad' manager who gives everyone A's."
*   **The Hiring Bar:**
    *   *Manager:* Lowers the bar to fill a seat fast.
    *   *Director:* "I am vetoing this hire. It is better to have an open seat than a B-player who drags down the org density."
