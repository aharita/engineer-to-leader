# Module 4: The Hiring Machine (Talent Acquisition)

**Hiring isn't an event. It's a pipeline.**

If you only recruit when someone quits, you are already dead.
Directors build a "Always On" hiring engine. You are selling the company, not just judging candidates.

## 1. The Bar Raiser
*Combating the "Desperation Hire".*

When a team is overworked, they will hire *anyone* with a pulse.
You must install a mechanism to stop this. The "Bar Raiser" is an interviewer from *another* team with veto power.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The False Positive:**
    *   *Manager:* "He's not great at coding, but he's a nice guy and we need a body."
    *   *Director:* **VETO.** "A bad hire takes 6 months to fire and destroys morale. We wait."
*   **The "Culture Fit" Bias:**
    *   *Manager:* "I don't think he'd fit in at happy hour."
    *   *Director:* "We hire for Culture Add, not Culture Fit. He brings a background in FinTech we lack. Hire him."
*   **The Closing:**
    *   *Manager:* Sends the offer letter and waits.
    *   *Director:* Calls the candidate. "I want you to join. Here is the vision. Here is why you matter." Executive outreach closes candidates.

## 2. Branding & Sourcing
*Why should the best work for you?*

You are competing with Google and OpenAI. You can't beat their salaries. You must beat them on *Mission*, *Autonomy*, and *Speed*.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Tech Blog:**
    *   *Manager:* Too busy to write.
    *   *Director:* Mandates one tech blog post per quarter. "We solved X scale problem." This is bait for Senior engineers.
*   **The Job Description:**
    *   *Manager:* Pastes a generic "5 years Java experience" list.
    *   *Director:* Rewrites it. "Come build the engine that processes $1B in transactions. You will own the Architecture." Sell the *problem*, not the requirements.
*   **The Diversity Pipeline:**
    *   *Manager:* "We only get male applicants."
    *   *Director:* "That's because we only source from your frat buddies on LinkedIn. We are going to sponsor 'Women in Tech' conferences and change our sourcing partners."
