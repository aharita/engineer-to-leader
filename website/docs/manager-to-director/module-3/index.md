# Module 3: The P&L (Budgeting)

**Your code compiles to Money.**

Engineers think resources are infinite. You know the truth. You have a budget. It is finite.
You are playing a strategy game called "Resource Allocation." You can buy people (Headcount) or you can buy tools (Vendors). You usually can't afford both.

If you don't know your burn rate, you aren't a Director; you're just a glorified team lead with a credit card.

## 1. Headcount Planning (The Tetris Game)
*Asking for bodies.*

You don't just ask for "more people." You ask for "Revenue Capacity."
"If you give me $500k for 3 engineers, I can deliver the Enterprise feature which unlocks $2M in ARR."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Vague Ask:**
    *   *Manager:* "We are drowning. We need help."
    *   *Director:* "Finance will say no. Show me the *impact* of not hiring. 'We will miss the Q3 launch.' Now Finance listens."
*   **The Contractor Lever:**
    *   *Manager:* "We need a full-time hire for this migration."
    *   *Director:* "It's a one-time project. I won't give you headcount (OpEx commit for years). I will give you $100k for a contractor (CapEx one-time). Get it done."
*   **The "Seniority" Mix:**
    *   *Manager:* Wants 5 Seniors.
    *   *Director:* "We can't afford 5 Seniors. You get 1 Staff, 1 Senior, and 3 Juniors. It is your job to train the Juniors. That is how we scale efficiently."

## 2. Vendor Negotiation (Cloud Costs)
*AWS is not a charity.*

Your cloud bill is your second biggest expense after salaries.
If you let it grow unchecked, you are burning the company's runway. AWS Sales Reps love sloppy Directors. Don't be their favorite customer.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The "On-Demand" Trap:**
    *   *Manager:* Spins up GPU instances.
    *   *Director:* "We are committing to a 1-year Savings Plan / Reserved Instances. This saves 40%. I need you to commit to this architecture for 1 year. Can you?"
*   **The SaaS Sprawl:**
    *   *Manager:* "Team A wants Trello, Team B wants Asana, Team C wants Monday."
    *   *Director:* "We are buying ONE Enterprise license for Jira. Volume discount. I don't care if the UI is worse. It saves us $50k/year."
*   **The "Build vs Buy":**
    *   *Manager:* "We can build our own Search for free!"
    *   *Director:* "Maintenance is not free. Engineering time is $100/hour. Buying Algolia is cheaper than you fixing Elasticsearch on a Sunday."
