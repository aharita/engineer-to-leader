# Module 7: Executive Presence (Politics)

**Politics is just "Human Engineering" at scale.**

You sit in a room with the VP of Sales, VP of Marketing, and CFO.
They don't care about code. They care about their own bonuses.
You have to defend Engineering's interests while looking like a team player.
If you talk about "Refactoring" or "Kubernetes" in this room, you will lose funding.

## 1. Managing the CEO / Board
*Brief, bright, and gone.*

Executives have the attention span of a gnat and the memory of an elephant.
Do not show them Jira. Show them: **Red/Yellow/Green.**
Never lie. They will find out.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Elevator Pitch:**
    *   *Manager:* Explains the technical complexity of the database migration.
    *   *Director:* "We migrated the database. It's faster and cheaper. No downtime. Next topic."
*   **The Bad News:**
    *   *Manager:* Hides the delay until the last minute.
    *   *Director:* "We are Red on the Q4 launch. The blocker is Vendor X. I am escalating. Here is the mitigation plan." Bad news must travel fast.
*   **The Translation:**
    *   *CEO:* "Why is this taking so long?"
    *   *Director:* *Don't say:* "The code is messy." *Say:* "We are ensuring security compliance so we don't get sued like Competitor Y."

## 2. Cross-Functional Warfare
*Sales vs. Engineering.*

Sales wants to sell features that don't exist. Engineering wants to build features nobody buys.
You are the diplomat. You are the only thing stopping Sales from promising a "Time Machine" feature to a client.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The "Just one small thing":**
    *   *Sales VP:* "I promised this feature to close the deal. Can you build it this weekend?"
    *   *Director:* "No. But I can give you a workaround for now, and we will put it on the Q2 roadmap. If I prioritize this, the Enterprise launch slips. Which one do you want?" (Trade-offs).
*   **The Blame Game:**
    *   *Marketing:* "The site crashed during the Super Bowl ad!"
    *   *Director:* "We weren't told about the ad. Next time, invite us to the planning meeting and we will scale the servers. This is a process failure, not an engineering failure."
*   **The Resource Fight:**
    *   *Product VP:* "I want 100% of engineers on features."
    *   *Director:* "If we do that, the system collapses in 6 months. I am keeping 20% for maintenance. This is non-negotiable."
