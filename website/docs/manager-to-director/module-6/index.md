# Module 6: Strategy & Vision (The North Star)

**Managers look at next week. Directors look at next year.**

If your team is working hard but going in the wrong direction, it is your fault.
You define "Winning."

---

## 1. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
*Making goals that aren't useless.*

Bad OKR: "Rewrite the backend." (Output)
Good OKR: "Reduce checkout latency by 50% to increase conversion." (Outcome)
You shift the org from "Feature Factory" to "Impact Factory."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Laundry List:**
    *   *Manager:* Has 15 priorities.
    *   *Director:* "If you have 15 priorities, you have 0. Pick the Top 3. Everything else is a 'Nice to have' that we will probably cut."
*   **The Alignment:**
    *   *Manager:* "We are building a Chat feature."
    *   *Director:* "The Company Goal is 'Profitability'. How does Chat help Profitability? It doesn't? Kill it."
*   **The Sandbag:**
    *   *Manager:* Sets easy goals to look good.
    *   *Director:* "These targets are too low. We need 'Stretch Goals'. If we hit 100% of our goals, we weren't ambitious enough. Aim for 70% of the impossible."

## 2. Technical Vision
*Where will the tech stack be in 3 years?*

You don't pick the libraries, but you pick the direction.
"We are moving from Monolith to Services." "We are becoming an AI-first company."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Legacy Trap:**
    *   *Manager:* "We can keep patching the PHP app."
    *   *Director:* "We cannot hire good engineers for PHP anymore. The 3-year vision is a migration to Go. Start the Strangler Fig pattern now."
*   **The Hype Train:**
    *   *Manager:* "Let's rewrite in [New Framework]."
    *   *Director:* "Does this give us a 'Right to Win'? Does it make us 10x faster? No? Then we stay on the boring stack. Innovation tokens are expensive."
*   **The Debt Paydown:**
    *   *Manager:* Can't get time for refactoring.
    *   *Director:* "I am reserving 20% of our capacity for 'Engineering Excellence'. You don't need to ask Product for permission. It is a tax we pay to keep the lights on."
