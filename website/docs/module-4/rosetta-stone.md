# The Rosetta Stone: Engineering to English

## The Hook
**Your boss doesn't care about Kubernetes.**

They care about: **Revenue, Retention, and Risk.**

If you explain a problem using technical jargon, you are asking your boss to do the translation work for you. They won't. They will just say "No." To get resources, you must speak their language.

## The Framework: The Translation Layer
Before you speak, map your technical issue to a business outcome.

*   *Tech:* "We need to upgrade the database version."
*   *Biz:* "We need to prevent a security breach that could cost us compliance certification."

*   *Tech:* "We need to refactor the frontend."
*   *Biz:* "We need to reduce mobile load times to improve user conversion rates."

## The Script
**Scenario:** Asking for budget for a new SaaS tool.

**Don't say:** "This tool has better CI/CD integration."

**Say this:**
> "Our engineers currently spend 4 hours a week waiting for builds. This tool costs $500/month but will save us 40 engineering hours a month. That is roughly $4,000 in recovered productivity. The ROI is immediate. Can I approve the expense?"

## The Challenge
**The "So What?" Game.**

Look at your last status email. Read every bullet point and ask "So what?"

*   "Refactored API." → **So what?** → "Reduced latency by 200ms." → **So what?** → "Improved customer experience for high-value users."

Rewrite the email using the final sentence.
