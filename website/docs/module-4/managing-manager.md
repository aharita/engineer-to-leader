# Managing Your Manager

## The Hook
**Your manager cannot read your mind.**

If you are frustrated, overworked, or bored, and you haven't told your manager explicitly, they assume you are fine.

Managing Up means taking ownership of your relationship with your boss. You manage *them* as much as they manage *you*.

## The Framework: The Solutions Default
Never bring your boss a naked problem. Bring a problem + a proposed solution.

*   **Bad:** "We are going to miss the deadline." (Now your boss has to solve it).
*   **Good:** "We are at risk of missing the deadline. I propose we cut Feature C to save time, or we add a contractor to help with testing. I recommend cutting Feature C. Thoughts?"

## The Script
**Scenario:** Your boss gives you a vague goal like "improve quality."

**Say this:**
> "I want to make sure I hit the mark. When you say 'improve quality,' does success look like reducing the bug count by 10%, or is it about zero downtime during the next launch? Let's align on the metric."

## The Challenge
**The Weekly Digest.**

Send your manager a confusingly short email every Friday.

*   **Subject:** Weekly Update - Team X
*   **Content:**
    1.  **Highlights:** 2 things we shipped.
    2.  **Lowlights:** 1 thing that went wrong (and how we fixed it).
    3.  **Risks:** 1 thing I am worried about for next week.

This makes you look in control and prevents surprises.
