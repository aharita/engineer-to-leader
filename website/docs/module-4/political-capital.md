# Political Capital & Influence

## The Hook
**Politics is not dirty; it is necessary.**

"I just want to do good work" is a naive strategy. In a company, resources (money, headcount, attention) are finite. You are competing for them.

Politics is simply **relationship engineering**. If you only talk to other departments when you need something, you have already failed.

## The Framework: The Bank Account
Every positive interaction deposits "social capital." Every request withdraws it.

*   **Deposit:** Helping Support debug an issue. Explaining a feature to Sales. Delivering on time.
*   **Withdrawal:** Asking for headcount. Delaying a launch. Pushing back on a requirement.
*   **Rule:** You must be "in the black" before you make a withdrawal.

## The Script
**Scenario:** A Sales Director is angry about a bug.

**Say this:**
> "I understand this is hurting your deal. I'm going to pull an engineer off our roadmap work to fix this immediately because I know how important this client is. I'll need your support later when we discuss Q4 capacity."

## The Challenge
**The Coffee Chat.**

Schedule a 15-minute coffee (virtual or real) with a peer in **Product, Design, or Sales**.

Do not talk about work. Ask them: "What is keeping you up at night regarding your goals this quarter?"

Listen. Build the alliance now.
