# Module 5: Communication & Visibility (Loud Work)

**If you do great work in the forest and nobody sees it, you didn't do it.**

Engineers hate "politics." They hate "marketing." They just want to code.
But here is the secret: **Visibility is not vanity. It is utility.**

If your manager doesn't know what you are doing, they can't help you. If the team doesn't know what you are building, they will build the same thing.

## 1. The Art of the Status Update
*Nobody reads your 5-paragraph essay.*

Your manager is busy. They want to know 3 things:
1.  **What did you do?** (Briefly)
2.  **Are you on track?** (Yes/No)
3.  **Are you blocked?** (Help me)

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Rambler:**
    *   *Junior:* "Well, I tried to install the library but the version was wrong, so I looked at the docs..." (5 minutes later) "...so I'm still working on it."
    *   *Senior:* "I'm working on the Auth feature. Hit a snag with the library version, but I have a workaround. Expecting to finish by EOD. No blockers."
*   **The Wall of Text:**
    *   *Junior:* Writes a 500-word daily standup message detailing every function they touched.
    *   *Senior:* "Yesterday: Fixed Auth Bug. Today: API integration. Blockers: None."
*   **The Ghost:**
    *   *Junior:* Skips standup because "I have nothing to say."
    *   *Senior:* "Still investigating the memory leak. It's trickier than expected. Will update at noon."

## 2. "No Surprises"
*Bad news is better than late news.*

The worst thing you can do is say "Everything is fine" for 2 weeks, and then on the day of the deadline say "I'm not done."

If you are going to miss a deadline, tell people **early**.
"Hey, this task is more complex than I thought. I might need 2 extra days."
Most managers can handle a delay. They cannot handle a surprise.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Optimist:**
    *   *Junior:* "I can do it in 2 days!" (Takes 5 days).
    *   *Senior:* "It looks like a 2-day task, but I'll estimate 3 days to account for testing and code review."
*   **The Hero:**
    *   *Junior:* Stays up all night to hit the deadline without telling anyone they are behind. Burns out.
    *   *Senior:* "I'm at risk of missing the deadline. Can we cut scope or get help?"
*   **The Silent Struggle:**
    *   *Junior:* Hits a blocker on Monday. Tells manager on Friday.
    *   *Senior:* Hits a blocker on Monday. Tells manager on Monday afternoon.

## 3. Documentation as Communication
*Write it down.*

If you explain something to a teammate verbally, you helped one person.
If you write it in a doc, you help everyone who joins the team forever.

*   **The README:** If I clone your repo, how do I run it?
*   **The Architecture Decision Record (ADR):** *Why* did we choose React over Vue? Write it down so we don't have the same argument in 6 months.

:::tip Pro Tip
**If you answer the same question twice, write a doc.**
The first time, answer it. The second time, write it in a Notion doc/Wiki and send the link. The third time, just send the link. You just automated yourself.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Bus Factor:**
    *   *Junior:* Keeps all the deployment knowledge in their head.
    *   *Senior:* Writes a "Deployment Runbook" so that anyone can deploy if they get hit by a bus (or win the lottery).
*   **The Oral Tradition:**
    *   *Junior:* "Ask Sarah how the billing system works."
    *   *Senior:* "Read `docs/billing-architecture.md`."
*   **The Slack Search:**
    *   *Junior:* Searches Slack for a code snippet someone posted 3 months ago.
    *   *Senior:* Puts that snippet in the team's shared code snippets or wiki.

## 4. Meeting Participation
*Don't be a potted plant.*

If you are in a meeting, contribute. If you have nothing to contribute, ask why you are in the meeting.

*   **Ask questions:** "What is the goal of this feature?"
*   **Clarify requirements:** "Does this include mobile support?"
*   **Take notes:** Be the person who sends the summary email. It gives you immense power and visibility.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Silent Observer:**
    *   *Junior:* Sits in the back, checks phone, says nothing.
    *   *Senior:* "I have a concern about the timeline. Have we considered the dependency on the mobile team?"
*   **The Hijacker:**
    *   *Junior:* Derails the meeting to talk about a specific bug they found.
    *   *Senior:* "That's a good point, let's take that offline so we don't hold up the meeting."
*   **The Note Taker:**
    *   *Junior:* Relies on memory.
    *   *Senior:* "I'll send out a recap with action items." (Becomes the de-facto leader of the project).

## 5. Summary
*   **Be concise.** Respect people's time.
*   **Flag risks early.** No surprises.
*   **Write it down.** Docs > Talk.
*   **Speak up.** Your opinion matters.

Communication is the API for your career.
