# Module 8: Career Navigation (The Promotion Game)

**Hope is not a strategy.**

You don't get promoted just because you worked hard. You get promoted because you delivered value and *people noticed*.
Career growth is an engineering problem. You need a plan, metrics, and execution.

---

## 1. The Promo Packet
*Start writing it now.*

Do not wait until performance review season to remember what you did 6 months ago. You will forget.
*   **The Brag Document:** Keep a running doc of your wins.
    *   "Shipped Feature X (Date)"
    *   "Fixed critical bug Y (Link to PR)"
    *   "Mentored New Hire Z"
    *   "Gave tech talk on A"

When review time comes, you just copy-paste.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Forgotten Win:**
    *   *Junior:* Tries to remember what they did 6 months ago during review season. Comes up blank.
    *   *Senior:* Opens their Brag Doc. "I shipped 8 major features, reduced latency by 30%, and mentored 3 juniors. Here are the metrics."
*   **The Quantified Impact:**
    *   *Junior:* "I worked on the checkout page."
    *   *Senior:* "I improved the checkout conversion rate by 15%, which led to $2M in additional revenue."
*   **The Visibility:**
    *   *Junior:* Does great work silently.
    *   *Senior:* Posts updates in the team channel: "Shipped the payment API today. It's handling 1000 req/sec with 99.9% uptime."

## 2. Impact > Effort
*Nobody cares how hard you worked.*

They care about the result.
*   **Bad:** "I rewrote the backend in Rust." (So what?)
*   **Good:** "I reduced server costs by 50% and improved latency by 200ms by rewriting the backend." (Promote this person).

Always tie your work to business metrics. Revenue, User Growth, Cost Savings, Velocity.

:::tip Pro Tip
**The STAR Method for Career Stories.**
When talking about your achievements, use the STAR format:
*   **Situation:** What was the problem?
*   **Task:** What did you need to do?
*   **Action:** What did you do?
*   **Result:** What was the impact? (Quantify it!)

Example: "We had a critical payment bug (S) that was causing failed transactions (T). I debugged the issue, found a race condition, and deployed a fix within 2 hours (A). This prevented $50k in lost revenue that day (R)."
:::

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Effort Flex:**
    *   *Junior:* "I worked 60 hours this week."
    *   *Senior:* "I automated the deployment process, which will save the team 10 hours per week going forward."
*   **The Vanity Metric:**
    *   *Junior:* "I wrote 10,000 lines of code."
    *   *Senior:* "I deleted 10,000 lines of code and simplified the architecture."
*   **The Business Outcome:**
    *   *Junior:* "I added caching."
    *   *Senior:* "I added caching, which reduced page load time from 3 seconds to 500ms. This improved user retention by 8%."

## 3. Managing Up
*Help your manager help you.*

Your manager is not a mind reader. Tell them what you want.
*   "I want to be a Senior Engineer in 12 months. What are the gaps in my skills?"
*   "I want to work on the new Architecture project."

If you don't ask, the answer is always no.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Passive Wait:**
    *   *Junior:* Assumes the manager will promote them when they are "ready."
    *   *Senior:* "I've been operating at the Senior level for 6 months. Here is my Promo Packet. Can we discuss a timeline?"
*   **The Feedback Loop:**
    *   *Junior:* Waits for annual review to get feedback.
    *   *Senior:* Asks for feedback every 1:1. "How am I tracking toward my goal of becoming a Tech Lead?"
*   **The Strategic Ask:**
    *   *Junior:* "I want a promotion."
    *   *Senior:* "I noticed the team is growing. I'd like to help with the hiring and onboarding process. That would give me experience in leadership."

---

## 4. Networking (Internal & External)
*It's who knows what you know.*

*   **Internal:** Build relationships with Product, Design, and other Engineering teams. You need allies to get things done.
*   **External:** Write blog posts, give talks, contribute to Open Source. Your market value is determined by your reputation outside the company.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Silo:**
    *   *Junior:* Only talks to engineers on their team.
    *   *Senior:* Has coffee chats with Product Managers, Designers, and engineers from other teams. Knows who to call when they need help.
*   **The Internal Brand:**
    *   *Junior:* Works quietly.
    *   *Senior:* Volunteers to give a tech talk at the company All-Hands. "Here is how we scaled the database."
*   **The External Presence:**
    *   *Junior:* No LinkedIn, no GitHub, no blog.
    *   *Senior:* Writes a blog post about a bug they solved. It trends on Hacker News. Recruiters start reaching out.

## 5. Summary
*   **Track your wins.** Write the Brag Doc.
*   **Focus on impact.** Numbers speak louder than code.
*   **Ask for it.** Be clear about your goals.
*   **Build your brand.** Be visible.

You are the CEO of your own career. Good luck.
