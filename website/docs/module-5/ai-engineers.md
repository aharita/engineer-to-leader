# Managing AI-Augmented Engineers

## The Hook
**Code is cheap. Thinking is expensive.**

With AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT), your junior engineers can write senior-level code—but they might not understand it.

Your risk has shifted from "syntax errors" to "subtle logic flaws" and security vulnerabilities.

## The Framework: Policy vs. Policing
Do not ban AI. That is impossible. Instead, regulate the **Review**.

*   **The Rule:** "You can use AI to write the code, but you must be able to explain every line during the Code Review. 'Copilot wrote it' is not a valid defense."
*   **The Shift:** Code Reviews must become more rigorous. Focus on security and edge cases, not style.

## The Script
**Scenario:** Establishing AI guidelines for the team.

**Say this:**
> "We want to use AI to move faster. Use it for boilerplate, tests, and documentation. However, do not paste proprietary customer data into public LLMs. And remember: if the AI introduces a bug, YOU introduced the bug. You own the output."

## The Challenge
**The AI Audit.**

Ask your team in the next standup: "What is the best prompt you used this week to save time?"

Encourage sharing. If they are hiding their AI use, you are missing out on productivity gains.
