# Remote/Hybrid Culture Building

## The Hook
**You cannot rely on "Watercooler Moments."**

In a remote team, culture does not happen by accident. It must be engineered.

If you only talk to your team about work tasks, they will feel like transactional cogs in a machine. Isolation leads to attrition.

## The Framework: Asynchronous Bonding
Stop trying to force "Zoom Happy Hours" (everyone hates them). Build culture into the workflow.

*   **The Check-in:** Start every meeting with 5 minutes of human talk.
*   **The Channels:** Create Slack channels for #pets, #cooking, #gaming.
*   **The Docs:** Write *everything* down. Remote culture relies on documentation. If it isn't written, it didn't happen.

## The Script
**Scenario:** A remote engineer seems disengaged in meetings.

**Say this:**
> "I've noticed you've been quiet lately. Remote work can be isolating. How is your setup working for you? Do you feel connected to what the rest of the team is doing, or do we need to adjust our sync cadence?"

## The Challenge
**The "User Manual" Exercise.**

Have everyone on the team (including you) write a 1-page "User Manual" for themselves.

*   *My working hours.*
*   *How I like to receive feedback.*
*   *My pet peeves.*

Share these. It short-cuts months of awkward "getting to know you" friction.
