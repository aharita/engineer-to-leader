# 1.3 Trust vs. Micromanagement (The 85% Rule)

## The Hook

**"It would be faster if I just did it myself."**

Yes, it would. Today.

But if you do it today, you have to do it next week, too. And next month. You are training your team to be helpless.

## The Framework: The 85% Rule

As a Senior Engineer, your standard is 100%. As a Manager, your new standard for delegation is **85%**.

- If a team member can do the task **85% as well as you**, let them do it.
- The gap between their 85% and your 100% is not "failure." **It is the cost of their education.**
- If you correct that last 15%, you are micromanaging. You are robbing them of the feeling of ownership.

:::info Why 85%?
Research shows that most "perfect" solutions aren't actually 15% better than "good enough" solutions. The marginal value of perfection rarely justifies the cost in time, morale, and team growth.

## The Script

**Scenario:** Reviewing a PR that works, but isn't written exactly how *you* would write it.

**Do NOT say:**

> *"Change lines 45-50 to use a map function instead of a loop."*

**Say this:**

> *"This logic is solid and the tests pass. Approved. (Optional Note: In the future, check if a map function might be more readable here, but no need to change it for this PR)."*

## The Challenge

### Delegate the Solution, not the Task

Next time you assign work, describe the **Problem** and the **Constraint**, but not the **Implementation**.

- **Bad:** "Write a Python script to scrape X and put it in Y."
- **Good:** "We need this data in our database by Friday. How do you think we should get it there?"

**Success looks like:**
- Assigning at least one task where you describe the goal, not the implementation
- Approving at least one PR that you would have written differently
- Noticing when you're about to "fix" something that's already good enough

## Key Takeaways

:::tip The 85% Rule in Practice
If someone can do it 85% as well as you, delegate it. If they can only do it 50% as well? Pair with them. If they can't do it at all? Teach them or hire differently.
