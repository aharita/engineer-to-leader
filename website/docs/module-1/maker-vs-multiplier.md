# 1.1 The Maker vs. Multiplier Metric

## The Hook

**You are addicted to the dopamine hit of "Done."**

As a Senior Engineer, your value was measured in Commits, PRs merged, and tickets closed. You pressed a button, and something worked. Immediate gratification.

**Management has no "Done" button.** If you try to maintain your coding volume while managing, you will burnout within 6 months, and your team will stagnate.

## The Framework: Andy Grove's Equation

Stop maximizing your own output. Start maximizing the equation from *High Output Management*:

> **Manager Output = (Output of your team) + (Output of the teams you influence)**

- **The Trap:** If you code 40 hours a week, you add 1 unit of value.
- **The Goal:** If you spend 1 hour unblocking 5 engineers, you add 5 units of value.
- **The Hard Truth:** You must mourn the death of your "Maker" identity. You are now a "Multiplier."

## The Script

**Scenario:** The team asks you to pick up a ticket because "you can do it fastest."

**Say this:**

> *"I know I could knock this out quickly, but my calendar is blocked with planning for Q3. If I take this, I'll become the bottleneck and block the release. @[Name], I want you to take this one. I'm available for a 15-min pairing session if you get stuck on the architecture."*

## The Challenge

### The "Zero Commit" Week

For the next 5 days, do not push a single line of feature code. If you find yourself opening the IDE to fix a bug, stop. Assign it to a Junior/Mid-level engineer and pair with them instead.

**Success looks like:**
- Zero commits from you in GitHub
- At least 2 pairing sessions where you coached someone through a problem
- Identifying one systemic blocker that affects multiple team members

## Key Takeaways

:::tip Remember
Your job is no longer to ship code. Your job is to build a team that ships code without needing you.
