# Module 1: The Rewire (Identity Shift)

**Stop coding. Start leading.**

Congratulations on your promotion. You are now "Post-Technical." I know, I know, you think you're still going to contribute to the codebase. You think you’ll be a "Player-Coach." That’s cute.

The truth is, the dopamine loop you’ve been addicted to for the last decade—write code, tests pass, green checkmark, feel good—is gone. You are now in the business of *people*, and people don't have unit tests. They have feelings, mortgage payments, and weird opinions about tabs vs. spaces.

This module is about killing the "Maker" inside you so the "Manager" can live. It’s going to hurt.

## 1. The Maker vs. Multiplier Metric
*Why lines of code are no longer your currency.*

As an IC, your value was output. You were a function: `Input(Coffee) -> Output(Features)`. As a manager, your value is the output of your *team*. If you are the smartest person in the room, you are a failure. If you are writing critical path code, you are a liability. You need to shift from additive value (doing the work) to multiplicative value (unblocking five people to do the work).

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The PR Review Trap:** instead of rewriting their "garbage code" in the comments to show off your superior knowledge, you ask a guiding question that helps them realize their mistake. You get 0 credit, they learn a lesson. That is the job.
*   **The Architecture Hero:** You *could* design the entire system in a weekend. If you do, your team learns nothing and you become the single point of failure. Instead, you facilitate a whiteboard session where *they* design it, and you just keep them from accidentally building Skynet.
*   **The "Helper":** You spend 4 hours debugging a Junior's environment. Result: You lost 4 hours of strategy time. Better Move: You pair the Junior with a Senior, freeing you up to argue with Product about timelines.

## 2. The "Empty Calendar" Panic
*Coping with the loss of tangible output and finding work in the white space.*

You will hit 5:00 PM on a Tuesday. You will look back at your day. You attended four Zoom calls, replied to 30 Slacks, and updated a Jira board. You wrote zero lines of code. Your brain will scream: *"I DID NOTHING TODAY. THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE ME."*

This is the phantom limb pain of the Engineer. You need to realize that "Talking to humans" and "Thinking about process" is now actual, billable work.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Context Switch:** You have 30 minutes between meetings. The old you would try to squash a bug. The new you realizes that 30 minutes isn't enough time to load the context into your brain, so you just stare at a wall. *This is fine.*
*   **The Doc Writer:** You spend 6 hours writing a "Team Onboarding Guide." It feels like bureaucracy. In reality, you just saved yourself from repeating the same 30-minute speech to every new hire for the next 5 years. That is high-leverage work.
*   **The Therapist:** You spent an hour listening to your Tech Lead vent about the PM. You feel like you wasted time. In reality, you just prevented your best engineer from rage-quitting. That hour was worth $150k in recruiting fees.

## 3. The 85% Rule (Delegation)
*Why you must let others do it worse than you (at first).*

Here is the hardest pill to swallow: You are better at coding than the people you manage. That’s why you got promoted. But if you wait for them to do it 100% as well as you would, you will do everything yourself, burn out, and your team will hate you. If they can do it 85% as well as you, **let them do it.** The 15% quality drop is the tax you pay for their growth.

:::tip Pro Tip
**The "Bus Factor" isn't just about people quitting.**
It's about them winning the lottery, having a baby, or just getting sick. If you can't survive a key person taking a 2-week vacation, you are not managing a team; you are managing a hostage situation.
:::

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Sloppy Script:** A report needs a migration script. You could write a bulletproof Python script in 10 mins. Your mid-level dev will take 4 hours and it’ll be kind of janky. **Let them write the janky script.**
*   **The Presentation:** Your Senior Dev has to present the roadmap. They are stuttering, the slides are ugly, and they missed a key point. You have the urge to jump in and "save" the meeting. **Don't.** Let them bomb (mildly). Then coach them afterward.
*   **The Tech Stack Choice:** The team wants to use a library you hate. It’s not *wrong*, it’s just not what *you* would pick. If it’s not fatal, let them pick it. Autonomy > Your aesthetic preferences.

## 4. The Heat Shield
*Being a "Sponge" vs. a "Conduit".*

Corporate leadership is a chaos engine. Executives change their minds every 48 hours. If you pass every piece of executive panic down to your team, they will get whiplash and stop trusting you. Your job is to be the Heat Shield. You absorb the radiation, filter out the noise, and only pass down the actionable signal. You are paid to have an ulcer so they don’t have to.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The CEO Panic:** The CEO reads a tweet about "AI Agents" and slacks you at 11 PM asking why we aren't using them.
    *   *Bad Manager (Conduit):* Forwards the message to the team: "Guys, drop everything, we need AI."
    *   *Good Manager (Shield):* Replies to CEO: "Interesting, I'll look into it," then never mentions it to the team ever again.
*   **The Deadline Shift:** Marketing moved the launch date up by two weeks.
    *   *Bad Manager:* "Marketing screwed us, work harder."
    *   *Good Manager:* "Scope negotiation time. We are cutting features X, Y, and Z to hit the new date."
*   **The Reorg Rumors:** You know a reorg is coming. The team is hearing whispers. You can't tell them yet. You have to look them in the eye, smile, and say, "Focus on the sprint," while you are secretly freaking out.

## 5. The Trust Battery
*Understanding how every interaction charges or drains your leadership capital.*

Think of your relationship with each direct report as a battery (thanks, Tobi Lütke). When you hire them, it’s at 50%.
*   **Charging:** Doing what you say, unblocking them, giving credit, admitting mistakes.
*   **Draining:** Canceling 1:1s, micromanaging, asking for weekend work, being "too busy."

If the battery is empty, everything you say is viewed with suspicion. If it’s full, you can ask them to walk through hell, and they’ll bring snacks.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The "Can you just..." Request:** You ask a dev to context-switch to fix a font size.
    *   *High Battery:* "Sure, boss."
    *   *Low Battery:* They update their LinkedIn profile status to 'Open to Work'.
*   **The 1:1 Cancellation:** You cancel your weekly 1:1 for the third time in a row because "Product needs me." You think you’re saving time. You are actually draining the battery to 0%. When you finally need to give them critical feedback, they won't hear it.
*   **Taking the Blame:** The team broke production.
    *   *Charging:* You stand in front of the VP and say, "This was a process failure, and I own the process."
    *   *Draining:* You say, "Well, Kevin pushed the bad commit." (Kevin will never forgive you).

## 6. Summary
*   **Be a multiplier.** Your value is your team's output, not yours.
*   **Embrace the chaos.** Empty calendars and ambiguous work are the job now.
*   **Delegate imperfectly.** 85% done by them beats 100% done by you.
*   **Shield your team.** Filter the noise from leadership.
*   **Charge the battery.** Every interaction builds or drains trust.

Welcome to management. The code you write now is people.
