# Module 7: The Calibration Room (Career Mechanics)

**The dark arts of the corporation. The administrative machinery most new managers fear.**

You think your job is leadership? No. Twice a year, your job is **lawyer**.

You will enter a room with other managers, HR, and Directors. You will put your team's ratings on a screen. And then, the battle begins. You have to defend your "Exceeds Expectations" rating for Sarah against a Director who thinks she "needs more visibility." If you lose, Sarah doesn't get her raise, and she quits.

This is the Calibration Room. It is a zero-sum game. Welcome to the Thunderdome.

## 1. The Invisible Bar
*How to write promotion packets that actually pass the committee.*

A promotion isn't a reward for past work; it's a business decision about future capacity. Most managers write promo packets like "Love Letters." You need to write them like "Legal Briefs."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The "Vibes" Packet:** "Dave is great! Everyone loves him. He works hard."
    *   *The Committee Result:* **Denied.** "Insufficient evidence of impact at the next level."
*   **The "Evidence" Packet:** "Dave led the migration of the payment gateway, which reduced transaction failures by 0.5%, saving the company $200k/year. Here are links to the Design Doc, the Post-Mortem, and the Dashboard."
    *   *The Committee Result:* **Approved.** It’s hard to argue with math.
*   **The "Gap Analysis":** You want to promote a Junior to Senior.
    *   *The Strategy:* Don't wait for the cycle. Six months prior, look at the "Senior" competency matrix. highlight exactly where they are failing. "You are doing Senior code, but Junior communication. Fix these 2 things and the promo is yours."

## 2. The Money Talk
*Navigating compensation conversations when you don't control the budget.*

"I think you deserve a 20% raise, but HR only approved 3%."
If you say this, you are a weak manager. You are throwing the company under the bus to save face. You must own the number, even if you hate the number.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Disappointment:** An engineer expected a promotion and didn't get it.
    *   *The Bad Move:* "I fought for you, but those idiots upstairs said no." (Now they hate the company).
    *   *The Leader Move:* "You didn't get the promo. The reason is X and Y. I failed to prepare you for this gap. Here is the plan to get you there in 6 months. I am in this with you."
*   **The "Market Rate" Fight:** "My friend at OpenAI makes $400k."
    *   *The Response:* Don't gaslight them. "Yes, they pay top of market. We pay 75th percentile. We compete on work-life balance and equity upside. If cash is your only driver, I can't beat OpenAI." (Honesty builds trust, even when the answer is no).
*   **The Equity Grant:** Giving stock options.
    *   *The Explanation:* Most devs don't understand taxes/vesting. Spend 30 minutes explaining "Strike Price" vs. "FMV." Teach them how their lottery ticket works. They will appreciate it more than the grant itself.

## 3. Surviving Calibration
*The politics of rating curves and defending your team against other managers.*

HR will often have a "Curve." Only 10% can be "Top Tier." Only 20% can be "Exceeds." If you have a team of all-stars, you have a problem. You have to fight other managers for those slots.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The "Horse Trading":** You want a "Top Tier" for your best dev. The Director says there are no spots left.
    *   *The Move:* You have to find a weak performer on *another* manager's list and argue (politely) that your dev had more impact than theirs. "My dev shipped the core revenue feature. Theirs shipped an internal tool. Why are they rated the same?" It’s brutal. It’s necessary.
*   **The "Sandbagger":** A manager rates everyone on their team as "Amazing."
    *   *The Reaction:* The room loses trust in them. Their ratings get adjusted down en-masse. Don't be this person. Be an honest grader so when you *do* fight for someone, people listen.
*   **The "New Guy" Tax:** You just joined. You don't have political capital.
    *   *The Strategy:* Bring data. Bring quotes from other teams praising your engineer. Borrow credibility from the ecosystem.

## 4. Managing Out
*The legal, ethical, and emotional process of firing someone gracefully.*

This is the worst day of the job. But keeping a toxic or underperforming employee is unfair to the high performers who have to carry their weight. Firing is a skill.

:::danger Trap
**Do not use the PIP as a legal shield.**
If you put someone on a PIP just to create a paper trail for firing them, the team will know. The PIP must be a genuine attempt to save them. If you have already decided to fire them, negotiate a severance package instead. It's cheaper and more humane.
:::

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The "Surprise" Firing:** You fire someone and they are shocked.
    *   *The Verdict:* You failed. Firing should *never* be a surprise. They should have seen the PIP, the feedback, and the missed goals coming for months.
*   **The Execution:** The meeting itself.
    *   *The Script:* keep it under 5 minutes. "This is your last day. We have made the decision to part ways."
    *   *The Trap:* They will argue. "But I did X!" Do not argue. "The decision is made." Arguments open legal liability. Be kind, be firm, be brief.
*   **The Aftermath:** The team will be scared. "Am I next?"
    *   *The Message:* "Bob is no longer with the company. We wish him the best. This was a specific performance issue we had been working on for a while. It does not affect anyone else's standing." Reassure the herd.

## 5. Summary
*   **Promotions require evidence.** Write legal briefs, not love letters.
*   **Own the compensation decision.** Don't blame HR.
*   **Fight in calibration.** Bring data, be honest, defend your top performers.
*   **Fire gracefully.** Never surprise them, and reassure the team afterward.

Calibration is where careers are made or broken.
