# Module 8: The Staff-Level Gap (Career Game)

**The hardest promotion in tech.**

Getting to Senior is inevitable if you keep coding.
Getting to Staff is a filter. Most people never make it.
To get promoted, you need a "Staff-Sized Problem." You cannot just do *more* Senior work. You need to find a problem that crosses team boundaries and solve it.

---

## 1. Finding Your "Sponsorship" Problem
*Don't ask for work. Propose work.*

If you wait for your manager to give you a Staff project, you will wait forever.
You must look at the organization, find a systemic inefficiency, and propose a solution.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Order Taker:**
    *   *Senior:* "What's in the backlog?"
    *   *Staff:* "I noticed we have 3 teams building 3 different date-pickers. I propose we pause that work, build a Design System team for 1 quarter, and unify the UI. This will save 20% dev time next year."
*   **The Business Case:**
    *   *Senior:* "I want to refactor the search."
    *   *Staff:* "Our search is slow, causing a 10% drop-off. I propose a re-architecture to ElasticSearch. I need 2 engineers for 3 months. The ROI is $1M/year."
*   **The Cross-Team Gap:**
    *   *Senior:* "The Mobile team keeps breaking the API."
    *   *Staff:* "I'm setting up a 'Contract Testing' framework (Pact) between Backend and Mobile to prevent this automatically. I'll get buy-in from the Mobile Lead."

## 2. Visibility is not Vanity
*If nobody knows you did it, you didn't do it.*

Staff work is often invisible (glue work, meetings, docs). You must make it visible.
This isn't bragging. It's "signaling alignment."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Silent Fix:**
    *   *Senior:* Fixes a major security hole. Tells nobody.
    *   *Staff:* Fixes the hole. Writes a post-mortem. Gives a "Lunch and Learn" on how to prevent XSS attacks. Now the whole org is smarter.
*   **The Newsletter:**
    *   *Staff:* Sends a bi-weekly "Engineering Update" email. "Here are the major architectural changes we made this week." Leadership reads this. Leadership remembers this.
*   **The Recruiting Helper:**
    *   *Senior:* Grumbles about doing interviews.
    *   *Staff:* Writes a blog post on the company tech blog about a hard problem they solved. Uses it to attract top talent. "Come work with us, we solve cool problems."

## 3. Summary
*   **Scope:** Solve for the org, not the ticket.
*   **Write:** RFCs and Design Docs are your primary output.
*   **Strategy:** Know the P&L and map tech to money.
*   **Architecture:** Buy over build. Thinking in NFRs.
*   **Ops:** MTTR over MTTF. Sleep at night.
*   **Glue:** Fix the build, clean the legacy, unblock the team.
*   **Career:** Propose your own work. Be visible.

Welcome to the Staff level. The problems are harder, the code is scarcer, and you have never been more important.
