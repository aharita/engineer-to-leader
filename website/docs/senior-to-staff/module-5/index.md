# Module 5: Influence & Politics (Herding Cats)

**Getting people to do what you want when you can't fire them.**

You are not their manager. You cannot order them to refactor the code. You have to *convince* them it was their idea.
This is "Soft Power." It is the art of being right without being annoying.
If you rely on "Authority" ("Do it because I'm Staff"), you have already lost.

## 1. Social Capital & Trust
*The Bank Account of Leadership.*

Every time you help someone, fix a build, or unblock a team, you deposit capital.
Every time you force a technical standard or say "No," you withdraw capital.
If you are overdrawn, people will nod in meetings and then ignore you.

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Ivory Tower Architect:**
    *   *The Failure:* Sits in a room, draws diagrams, hands them to the team. The team ignores them because "He doesn't know our codebase."
    *   *The Staff Move:* "I'm going to spend a week in the trenches with your team, fixing bugs and feeling your pain. *Then* I will propose an architecture." (Credibility earned).
*   **The "I told you so":**
    *   *Senior:* "I told you using Mongo was a mistake." (Everyone hates you).
    *   *Staff:* "Mongo is hurting us now. Here is a migration plan to Postgres that minimizes downtime. I'll take the lead on the hardest part." (Everyone loves you).
*   **The Code Review Nuke:**
    *   *Senior:* Leaves 50 comments on a PR ripping it apart.
    *   *Staff:* DMs the author. "Hey, I see where you're going with this PR, but I think the architecture might cause issues down the road. Can we do a 10-min sync?" Saves face, builds trust.

## 2. Consensus is a Trap
*Agreeing to disagree and moving forward.*

You will never get 10 engineers to agree on anything. If you wait for consensus, you will die of old age.
Staff Engineers push for "Consent," not "Consensus."
"Is this approach safe enough to try? Yes? Then we go."

**Real-world scenarios:**
*   **The Deadlock:**
    *   *Senior:* Team A wants gRPC. Team B wants GraphQL. They argue for 3 weeks.
    *   *Staff:* "Both work. We are going with GraphQL because our Frontend team is larger and they prefer it. Team A, I know you disagree, but I need you to commit to this path so we can ship."
*   **The Escalation:**
    *   *Senior:* Keeps arguing in the ticket.
    *   *Staff:* Calls a meeting. "We are leaving this room with a decision. If we can't decide, I will decide."
*   **The Pocket Veto:**
    *   *Senior:* Thinks everyone agreed, but the Tech Lead of Team B is silently ignoring the emails and stalling the work.
    *   *Staff:* Spots the silence. Confronts it. "Hey Team B Lead, I noticed you haven't approved the RFC. I assume this means you are blocking. What is your specific blocker?" Force the passive-aggression into the light.
