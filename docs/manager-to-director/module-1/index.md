# Module 1: Meta-Management (Managing Managers)

**You are now one step removed from reality. It is terrifying.**

When you managed engineers, you could look at the PRs. You could see the work. You could feel productive.
When you manage managers, you are managing a "Black Box." You input "Headcount and Strategy" and you hope "Software" comes out the other side. Spoiler: it usually doesn't.

You cannot micro-manage a manager. If you try, they will quit (or worse, become useless). You have to manage through *principles* and *signals*.

## 0. What Even IS a Director?

*Spoiler: It's not "Senior Manager with a fancier title."*

Let's be brutally honest about what changes when you cross the Rubicon from Manager to Director:

| Dimension | Manager | Director |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Scope** | 1 team (5-10 people) | Multiple teams (20-50+ people). You now have "an org." Congratulations, you're a small country. |
| **Focus** | Execution, shipping, individuals | Strategy, systems, org design. You're playing SimCity now. |
| **Time Horizon** | This sprint, this quarter | This year, next year. You think in roadmaps, not Jira tickets. |
| **Metric** | Team velocity, happiness | Org throughput, business outcomes. "Are we making money?" |
| **Hiring** | Interview candidates | Design the hiring machine. You interview Bar Raisers, not candidates. |
| **Performance** | Coach individuals | Calibrate managers. You grade the graders. |
| **Politics** | Mostly internal team | Cross-functional, exec-level. You now attend meetings with people who wear suits. |
| **Budget** | "I need more people" | "Here's the ROI for $500k in headcount." You speak Finance now. |

**The terrifying realization:** As a Manager, you could still *do the work* if you had to. As a Director, you physically cannot. There are too many teams, too many projects, too many fires. If you try to "do the work," you will fail at your actual job: making the system work.

Your job is no longer to *produce* output. Your job is to *design the machine* that produces output.

## 1. The "Coach, Don't Play" Rule

*Resisting the urge to be the 'Super-EM'.*

Your managers will make mistakes. They will run bad meetings. They will hire the wrong intern. They will promote the wrong person. They will create drama.
Your instinct is to jump in and fix it. **Don't.**
If you fix their problems, you rob them of the lesson. You are a safety net, not a crutch. You are a coach, not the star player who refuses to let anyone else touch the ball.

**Real-world scenarios:**

* **The Incident:**
  * *Manager:* Panics during an outage. Runs around like a headless chicken.
  * *Director:* "I am watching. I will not intervene unless the company is about to literally die. Afterward, we will deconstruct your response over a stiff drink."
* **The Bad Hire:**
  * *Manager:* Wants to hire a candidate with "red flags" because they are desperate.
  * *Director:* "I see these risks (X, Y). If you hire them, you own the outcome. Are you willing to bet your reputation on this?" (Forces them to think).
* **The Process Deviant:**
  * *Manager:* Refuses to do Sprint Retrospectives.
  * *Director:* "I don't care about the ritual. I care about the loop. Show me how your team improves over time. If you can't show improvement, you must adopt the standard ritual."

## 2. Skip-Level 1:1s (The Truth Serum)

*How to spy on your managers without being creepy.*

Your managers will filter information. They will tell you "Everything is fine" while the house burns. This is not malice; this is survival instinct. They don't want to look bad.
You need a direct line to the ground floor. Enter the Skip-Level.
**Goal:** Not to undermine the manager, but to "Health Check" the environment. Think of it as a code review for management.

**Real-world scenarios:**

* **The Vibe Check:**
  * *Manager:* "The team is happy."
  * *Director (in Skip-Level):* "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to quit tomorrow?" (Engineer says "8"). Director realizes Manager is blind.
* **The Broken Telephone:**
  * *Manager:* "Management says we have to work weekends."
  * *Director (in Skip-Level):* "I never said that. Your manager is using me as a scapegoat to push you. I will correct this."
* **The Career Blocker:**
  * *Manager:* "Dave isn't ready for promotion."
  * *Director (in Skip-Level):* Realizes Dave is doing Staff-level work but the Manager is threatened by him. Director intervenes to prevent Dave from quitting.

## 3. The "Standardization" Balance

*Autonomy vs. Chaos.*

You have 4 teams. Team A uses Scrum. Team B uses Kanban. Team C uses "Vibes." Team D uses "Chaos and hope."
Do you force them to align?
**Rule:** Standardize the *Interface*, not the *Implementation*.
"I don't care how you make the sausage, but every Friday at 4 PM, your status report must look exactly like this."

**Real-world scenarios:**

* **The Tool War:**
  * *Manager A:* Wants Jira. *Manager B:* Wants Linear.
  * *Director:* "We are using ONE tool. Standardization beats preference because we need to move engineers between teams. We use Linear. End of discussion."
* **The Performance Review:**
  * *Manager A:* Grades everyone "Exceeds." *Manager B:* Grades everyone "Meets."
  * *Director:* "We are doing a calibration session. I will normalize your curves. You cannot be the 'Cool Dad' manager who gives everyone A's."
* **The Hiring Bar:**
  * *Manager:* Lowers the bar to fill a seat fast.
  * *Director:* "I am vetoing this hire. It is better to have an open seat than a B-player who drags down the org density."
