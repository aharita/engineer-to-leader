# Module 8: The Staff-Level Gap (Career Game)

**The hardest promotion in tech. Welcome to the Hunger Games.**

Getting to Senior is inevitable if you keep coding and don't get fired.
Getting to Staff is a filter. Most people never make it. They stay Senior Engineers until they retire or become farmers.
To get promoted, you need a "Staff-Sized Problem." You cannot just do *more* Senior work. Doing 10 tickets a week instead of 5 doesn't make you Staff; it makes you tired.

## 1. Finding Your "Sponsorship" Problem

*Don't ask for work. Propose work. Be the CEO of your own career.*

If you wait for your manager to give you a Staff project, you will wait forever. Your manager is busy trying not to get fired.
You must look at the organization, find a systemic inefficiency, and propose a solution that saves the company money or time.

**Real-world scenarios:**

*   **The Order Taker:**
    *   *Senior:* "What's in the backlog? I'll take the top ticket."
    *   *Staff:* "I noticed we have 3 teams building 3 different date-pickers. I propose we pause that work, build a Design System team for 1 quarter, and unify the UI. This will save 20% dev time next year. I've already drafted the charter."
*   **The Business Case:**
    *   *Senior:* "I want to refactor the search because the code is messy."
    *   *Staff:* "Our search is slow, causing a 10% drop-off. I propose a re-architecture to ElasticSearch. I need 2 engineers for 3 months. The ROI is $1M/year. Here is the spreadsheet proving it."
*   **The Cross-Team Gap:**
    *   *Senior:* "The Mobile team keeps breaking the API. They are annoying."
    *   *Staff:* "I'm setting up a 'Contract Testing' framework (Pact) between Backend and Mobile to prevent this automatically. I'll get buy-in from the Mobile Lead. We are stopping the bleeding."

## 2. Visibility is not Vanity

*If nobody knows you did it, you didn't do it. Sad but true.*

Staff work is often invisible (glue work, meetings, docs, therapy sessions for juniors). You must make it visible.
This isn't bragging. It's "signaling alignment." If you don't tell the story, someone else will (or nobody will).

**Real-world scenarios:**

*   **The Silent Fix:**
    *   *Senior:* Fixes a major security hole. Tells nobody. Expects a medal. Gets nothing.
    *   *Staff:* Fixes the hole. Writes a post-mortem. Gives a "Lunch and Learn" on how to prevent XSS attacks. Now the whole org is smarter, and leadership knows who saved the day.
*   **The Newsletter:**
    *   *Staff:* Sends a bi-weekly "Engineering Update" email. "Here are the major architectural changes we made this week." Leadership reads this. Leadership remembers this when promotion packets are due.
*   **The Recruiting Helper:**
    *   *Senior:* Grumbles about doing interviews. "It takes time away from coding."
    *   *Staff:* Writes a blog post on the company tech blog about a hard problem they solved. Uses it to attract top talent. "Come work with us, we solve cool problems. Also, I'm famous."

## 3. Summary

* **Scope:** Solve for the org, not the ticket.
* **Write:** RFCs and Design Docs are your primary output. Code is secondary.
* **Strategy:** Know the P&L and map tech to money.
* **Architecture:** Buy over build. Thinking in NFRs. Don't reinvent the wheel.
* **Ops:** MTTR over MTTF. Sleep at night. Delete alerts.
* **Glue:** Fix the build, clean the legacy, unblock the team. Be the janitor.
* **Career:** Propose your own work. Be visible. Play the game.

Welcome to the Staff level. The problems are harder, the code is scarcer, and you have never been more important. Now go write a doc.
